## Pre-requisites

### Podman Machine
In order to be sure to not run out of resources, we'll use Podman Machine with 4CPU and 10GB memory at least, to run the demo.

### Kind Cluster setup
In order to run the demo, you need to have a Kind cluster running.

You can do so from the UI of Podman Desktop, in the Settings:

![login-devsandbox](https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-demo/blob/main/kind-demo/assets/create-cluster-1.png)

And use the following settings:
